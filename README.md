# Name_Standardization
Standardizing names using TFIDF and cosine similarity
This is the repository where I used TF-IDF and cosine similarity to standardize name entities in files for work, which saved labor work from hand cleaning entries.
Additional applications can be finding relevant descriptions of similar product (rather than using product's names)

## Data Type
Data entity contains customer company names, ending in LLC, LTD or INC

## Modification
using tfidfvectorizer to standardize entities based on their consine similarities
